* Overview

This emacs config is optimized for clojure(script) editing.  It is
also based on the idea of Spacemacs in that we have a leader key
'SPC', that prefixes our commands.

It also uses ~evil-mode~, so if Vi is your preference, then you'll be
happy. 

Finally it uses ~lispy~ which is structural editing for lispy like
files, i.e. clojure(script).  Think paredit, but not key-chords.

* Install

Once you have the cloned the repo, make a sym link to it:

: ln -s evil-lispy-emacs-init-file.git .emacs.d

ensure you have renamed your existing ~.emacs.d~ file.
